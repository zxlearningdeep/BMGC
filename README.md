# MAG Dataset

MAG is a large-scale citation network, constituting the largest dataset in multi-relation graph clustering thus far. MAG is a subset we extracted from [OGBN-MAG](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag), consisting of the four largest classes. MAG contains 113,919 papers with graphs generated by two meta-paths (paper-author-paper and paper-paper). Each paper is associated with a 128-dimensional word2vec feature vector. The processed MAG can be downloaded from the datasets link.

If you use the MAG dataset in your research, please make sure to cite our paper. Thank you!
